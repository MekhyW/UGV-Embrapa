Cloud Architecture
===================

During the development of the project, a cloud architecture was proposed to provide the following features:

- Storage of time series telemetry data from the robot.
- Storage of ROSBAG files with rosbags recorded by the robot (including SLAM, image and sensor data).
- Data processing, analysis, modeling and visualization.
- Remote monitoring and control of the robot using a web interface and a localization system.

Please refer to the `UGV-Embrapa-Cloud repository`_, which contains the diagram of implementation and Terraform IaC code.
